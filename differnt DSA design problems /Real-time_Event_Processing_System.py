# Problem Statement:
# Build a system that processes customer events in real-time and triggers appropriate actions. The system needs to:

# Handle high-volume event streams (thousands per second)
# Apply business rules to determine actions (send notification, create task, update score)
# Ensure events are processed exactly once
# Support complex event patterns (sequences, time windows)
# Maintain system state for stateful processing
# Provide backpressure handling when overwhelmed
